# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

##Overview
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The repo contains three scripts, all created to show the steps taken from a messy dataset and turning it into a tidy one.

##run_Analysis.R
This file contains the R script for transforming the dataset into a tidy dataset meant to solve the problems illustrated in the project. It includes the following five steps, as well as the initial download of the file.

1- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##CodeBook.md
This file explains the different variables contained within the dataset and their function.
